To give you a taste of your future career, we're going to walk through exactly the kind of notebook that you'd write as a data scientist. In the process, we'll be sure to signpost the general framework for our investigation - the Data Science Pipeline - as well as give reasons for why we're doing what we're doing.\n",

    "1. Sourcing and loading \n",

    " \n",
    "2. Cleaning, transforming and visualizing\n",
    "    * Check the data types and fix them\n",
    "    * Add a `platform` column to both the `Apple` and the `Google` dataframes\n",
    "    * Changing the column names to prepare for a join \n",
    "    * Join the two data sets\n",
    "    * Eliminate the `NaN` values\n",
    "    * Filter only those apps that have been reviewed at least once\n",
    "    * Summarize the data visually and analytically (by the column `platform`)  \n",
    "  \n",
    "  \n",
    "3. Modelling \n",
    "    * Hypothesis formulation\n",
    "    * Getting the distribution of the data\n",
